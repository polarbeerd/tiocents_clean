As a coffee and gym enthusiast, I've always been inquisitive about the effects of caffeine. Does it really have a significant impact on boosting performance? When and how should it be consumed for maximum effect?

Over time, I've found myself periodically diving deeper: following coffee experts like James Hoffmann (whoâ€™s brilliantly obsessed with coffee science), reading research papers whenever a question pops into my mind, and discussing personal experiences with friends.

In this post, I'm finally going to share my findings â€” putting an end to this whimsical curiosity once and for all.

## Science First

- As the day goes on, adenosine molecules naturally build up and bind to adenosine receptors, which:

  - Suppresses the activity of neurons, causing them to fire less frequently.
  - Leads to feelings of tiredness, fatigue, reduced focus, and decreased alertness.

- Caffeine molecules compete for and bind to adenosine receptors, blocking them:

  - Adenosine can no longer bind, preventing its fatigue-inducing effects.
  - This results in increased alertness, sharper focus, and improved performance.
  - Caffeine also suppresses your perception of effort and pain, allowing you to push a bit further physically.

- Caffeine enhances calcium release within muscle cells:

  - Greater calcium availability strengthens muscle contractions.

- In cardiac muscle tissue:
  - Caffeine promotes increased blood flow and oxygen delivery to muscles, supporting higher performance.

## How Roasting Affects Caffeine Content

There are small, specialized devices that can measure caffeine and chlorogenic acid levels from just a single drop of coffee.

In one of his experiments, James Hoffmann prepared pour-overs using different types of beans â€” keeping the amount of coffee constant â€” and measured the results.

> **Finding:** The caffeine content increases as the roasting level gets darker.

## My Daily Coffee Routine and a Surprising Discovery

<hr className="my-6 border-gray-600" />

As an espresso lover (and maybe I'll create a guide later on how to get the best-tasting, budget-friendly espresso at home if anyoneâ€™s interested), I usually start my day with two double-shot espressos. Occasionally, if I have some particularly aromatic beans around, I'll prepare a V60 pour-over instead.

But something always baffled me: the different neuroeffects I felt after drinking a V60 compared to my usual espresso. It turns out, there's a good reason for this.

Fortunately, James Hoffmannâ€™s experiments revealed that even when using the same amount of coffee grounds, pour-overs contain significantly more caffeine than espresso.

> **Finding:** Caffeine content increases with the contact time of water.

## SO WHAT DENIZ?

Okay relax, now that you've come to the end, you deserved the pill you've been waiting for.

> ðŸ§  **Tip:** International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends **3-6 mg/kg** caffeine for performance.

- âœ… **Daily dose** for 80kg person: **160-480mg caffeine**
- âœ… **For Pre-workout**: Lower end is usually enough, which is either:

  â†’ 2 double espressos ( 220mg caffeine )

  â†’ One large pour over ( 170mg caffeine )

- âœ… **Timing**: Around **45** minutes before exercise
- âœ… **About tolerance**: There might be withdrawal symptoms if you cut it after a period
  - You can limit the usage in the times of intence exercise days
  - Everybody is different, you can drink everyday if you feel good

## Stay caffeinated :)
