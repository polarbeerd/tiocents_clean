Hi there, and welcome! I'm really glad you're here.

**Tiocents** is my little corner of web2 where I share my two cents on the things that catch my attention. From oddly specific questions that randomly pop into my head (and send me deep into research mode) to everyday tips and reflections, this blog is a snapshot of how I make sense of the world.

## What is This?

This site isn’t just a blog, it's also a **personal project** I built with the help of various coding assistants. Part of the goal was to test how useful these tools actually are in building something from scratch, so far? **They’re doing a pretty good job.**

But beyond the tech experiment, this space serves a more personal purpose:  
I’m using **Tiocents** as a way to store my thoughts, document curiosities, and access them from anywhere, on any device. It’s about creating a **living archive** of ideas that might otherwise get lost in notes apps or scattered across devices.

## What to Expect

You’ll find posts on:

- **Strange Questions & Deep Dives**  
  I’m the kind of person who can’t let a question go unanswered. I research from many sources (and I mean _many_) until I feel like I’ve truly got it.

- **Tips from Everyday Life**  
  Practical advice, reflections, and tools I’ve found helpful in the little things we all go through.

- **Thoughts on Topics I Love**  
  From health to economy to random “huh” moments, if it makes me think, it’ll probably show up here.

Thanks for stopping by. Whether you're here out of curiosity, by accident, or looking for answers yourself, I hope something here resonates with you.

Stay curious,  
**Tio**
