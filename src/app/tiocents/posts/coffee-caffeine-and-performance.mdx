As a coffee and gym enthusiast, I've always been inquisitive about the effects of caffeine. Does it really have a significant impact on boosting performance? When and how should it be consumed for maximum effect?

Over time, I've found myself periodically diving deeper: following coffee experts like James Hoffmann (who’s brilliantly obsessed with coffee science), reading research papers whenever a question pops into my mind, and discussing personal experiences with friends.

In this post, I'm finally going to share my findings and putting an end to this whimsical curiosity once and for all.

## Science First

- As the day goes on, adenosine molecules naturally build up and bind to adenosine receptors, which:

  - Suppresses the activity of neurons, causing them to fire less frequently.
  - Leads to feelings of tiredness, fatigue, reduced focus, and decreased alertness.

- Caffeine molecules compete for and bind to adenosine receptors, blocking them:

  - Adenosine can no longer bind, preventing its fatigue-inducing effects.
  - This results in increased alertness, sharper focus, and improved performance.
  - Caffeine also suppresses your perception of effort and pain, allowing you to push a bit further physically.

- Caffeine enhances calcium release within muscle cells:

  - Greater calcium availability strengthens muscle contractions.

- In cardiac muscle tissue:
  - Caffeine promotes increased blood flow and oxygen delivery to muscles, supporting higher performance.

## How Roasting Affects Caffeine Content

There are small, specialized devices that can measure caffeine and chlorogenic acid levels from just a single drop of coffee.

In one of his experiments, James Hoffmann prepared pour-overs using different types of beans — keeping the amount of coffee constant — and measured the results.

> **Finding:** The caffeine content increases as the roasting level gets darker.

## My Daily Coffee Routine and a Surprising Discovery

<hr className="my-6 border-gray-600" />

As an espresso lover (and maybe I'll create a guide later on how to get the best-tasting, budget-friendly espresso at home if anyone’s interested), I usually start my day with two double-shot espressos. Occasionally, if I have some particularly aromatic beans around, I'll prepare a V60 pour-over instead.

But something always baffled me: the different neuroeffects I felt after drinking a V60 compared to my usual espresso. It turns out, there's a good reason for this.

Fortunately, James Hoffmann’s experiments revealed that even when using the same amount of coffee grounds, pour-overs contain significantly more caffeine than espresso.
